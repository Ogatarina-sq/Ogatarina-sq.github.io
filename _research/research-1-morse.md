An intelligent car platform for dual antenna radio direction finding  
------

Participated in the design and test of a dual-antenna radio direction finding experimental system. The platform is carried by the dual-antenna direction finding and ranging receiver of the smart car to complete the reception and demodulation of the long-distance beacon signal, and extract the distance, Angle data and sensor information to realize the search, positioning, tracking and operation control of the beacon. The system adopts superheterodyne digital IF receiver structure, and uses large-scale programmable devices to complete signal processing. We used the SignalTap analysis tool to collect data, completed the spectrum analysis of the AD sampled signal in Matlab, and used the dual antenna to measure the Angle and phase difference to complete the design of the car driver code.
